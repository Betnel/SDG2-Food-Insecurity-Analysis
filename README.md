# SDG2 â€” Food Insecurity & Nutritional Gap Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project applies the **CRISPâ€“DM framework** to explore global food insecurity using **World Development Indicators (WDI)** data.  
It highlights uneven progress, persistent nutrition gaps, and vulnerabilities to inflation shocks, aligned with **SDG2: Zero Hunger**.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Results
- **Uneven progress:** Some countries still exceed 30% undernourishment, others are below 5%.  
- **Nutrition â‰  calories:** Stunting and anemia persist even in middle-income countries.  
- **Price shocks:** Fragile economies are most vulnerable to inflation volatility.

## âœ… Recommendations
- **High-risk:** Scale safety nets, maternal/child nutrition, and yield-raising programs.  
- **Moderate:** Improve logistics, storage, and price stabilization.  
- **Resilient:** Diversify crops, adopt climate-smart agriculture.  
- **Inflation-sensitive:** Strengthen value chains and deploy price controls.
